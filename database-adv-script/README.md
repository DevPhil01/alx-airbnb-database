# PostgreSQL Join Queries

## Overview
This project contains sample SQL queries demonstrating different types of joins in PostgreSQL, based on the Airbnb Clone dataset.  
The queries are useful for practicing **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **FULL OUTER JOIN** operations.

## Queries Included
1. **INNER JOIN**  
   Retrieves all bookings along with the respective users who made those bookings.

2. **LEFT JOIN**  
   Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties that do not have any reviews.

3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**  
   Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up with the relevant tables (`users`, `properties`, `reviews`, `bookings`).  
2. Download and open the `joins_queries.sql` file.  
3. Run the queries in your PostgreSQL environment (e.g., **psql**, **PgAdmin**, or any PostgreSQL client).  

## File Structure
- `joins_queries.sql` â€“ Contains the SQL queries.

## Compatibility
- Tested on **PostgreSQL 13+**.
- Should work with any PostgreSQL-supported version with standard SQL join operations.

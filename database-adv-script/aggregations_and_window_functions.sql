-- 1) Total bookings per user

-- 2) Rank properties by total bookings â€” using ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
SELECT

    t.total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY t.total_bookings DESC)   AS row_number_rank,

      ON p.property_id = b.property_id
    GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
) AS t
ORDER BY t.total_bookings DESC;


-- 3) Example: ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by location (top property per location)
